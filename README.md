# Rice Growth Simulation
Python simulation of exponential rice growth
This Python project simulates the exponential growth of rice grains on a chessboard. It demonstrates the famous story of placing one grain of rice on the first square, two grains on the second square, and doubling the amount on each subsequent square.

## Getting started
To run the simulation, ensure you  have Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository using the following command:

bash
git clone https://github.com/AntonioLabinjan/Rice_Growth_Simulation.git

### Navigate to the project directory
cd rice-growth-simulation

### Install the required dependecies
pip install matplotlib

### Run the simulation
python rice_growth_simulation.py

## Features
<ul>Simulates the exponential growth of rice on chessboard</ul>
<ul>Provides the amount of rice on each square</ul>
<ul>Visualizes the growth using a logarithmic scale plot</ul>
